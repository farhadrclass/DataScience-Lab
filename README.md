# Zeppelin-DS-Lab

## Synopsis
The Zeppelin-DS-Lab is a shared colloboration of web notebooks primarily aimed at ramp up and training activities.  Several sub-branches have also been created to explore existing content using Jupyter formats as well.  It is hoped that future versions of Zeppelin will be more flexible in their import/export abilities with filesystem metadata as well as Jupyter formatting.

## Code Example
Ensure that Zeppelin is confifured to use the GitNotebookRepository and Zeppelin-DS-Lab unpacked into your ZEPPELIN_HOME folder (/usr/hdp/current/zeppelin-server)

## Motivation
Working across many environments testing different libraries, hardware and hosts makes the process of importing, exporing and formatting web notebooks both tiresome, manual and error prone.  Integration into git allows for both collaboration and sharing across environments, with co-workers as well as version control to undo any late night mistakes

## Installation
Please follow the existing branch and folder structure and feel free to add content within that branch.  New branches may be moved by admin.
